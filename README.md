# Thomas Course Project 1
 
Welcome to my Docker Microservice Hub!

To start, enter **git clone https://github.com/jet113/Thomas-Course-Project-1** in your terminal to clone the repository to your computer. (The repo can be pulled in other ways as well)

Then cd into the repository. 

Then run **docker-compose up**

It may take a few minutes for everything to install. 

Then go to your web-browser (I use Google Chrome) and go to http://localhost:5000 

From there, simply click on the name of whatever application you'd like to launch.

To stop the container, enter control + C in the terminal to exit all containers.

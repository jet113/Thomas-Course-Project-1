# Thomas Course Project 1
 
Welcome to my Docker Microservice Hub!

To run, pull the github repository to your computer using the terminal.

Then cd into the repository. 

Then run **docker-compose up**

It may take a few minutes for everything to install. 

Then go to your web-browser (I use Google Chrome) and go to http://localhost:5000 


From there, simply click on the name of whatever application you'd like to launch.

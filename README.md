# Thomas Course Project 1
 
Welcome to my Docker Microservice Hub!

1. Enter **git clone https://github.com/jet113/Thomas-Course-Project-1** in your terminal to clone the repository to your computer. (The repo can be pulled in other ways as well)

2. Cd into the repository. 

3. Open the docker-compose.yml file and change any DISPLAY enviornment variables to equal your local IP address.

4. run **docker-compose up**

NOTE: It may take a few minutes for everything to install. If you go to localhost:5000 and nothing is visible OR the links aren't working, then docker-compose isn't finished setting up yet.

5. Go to your web-browser (I use Google Chrome) and go to http://localhost:5000 

6. From there, simply click on the name of whatever application you'd like to launch.

NOTE: If any application asks you for a password, the password = password

7. To stop the container, enter control + C in the terminal to exit all containers.
